The file names are hopefully self explanatory. 

Essentially the file should be useful as follows:

`designed_not_ordered_nor_made.csv` are those compounds that should still be considered for ordering.

`ordered_not_made.csv` are those compounds that have been ordered but are still being synthesized/in transit, and have not been received yet.

`made.csv` are all of those compounds that have been recieved.

`made_not_assayed.csv` are all those that we have received that still have to be assayed.

All the files are derived from `get_status_info.py`
