The generated children SMILES each have two parents. These SMILES were then used to generated a 3d conformer (with `smi23d`) which was refined with the MM94FF in `obminimize`. The resulting candidate molecule was then docked with Autodock Vina, against 6YB7 selecting near the catalytic site . From these 100'000 data points, the 20 highest scoring docked compounds were selected for submission. 

No additional human or algorithmic filtering has been done. (Note the double sulphone warhead in one of the molecules!)

I chose this method due to bitter experience in molecular design with both computational and machine learning approaches. Due to the exponentially large chemical configuration space, any attempt to optimise a metric with errors (such as docking) will lead to the selection of the much more numerous false-positives than a genuine hit. By constraining the design algorithm to mixing two known-valid molecules (the fragments from Diamond), you strongly bias the exploration of chemical space to plausible regions, while giving sufficient freedom for the algorithm to select arbitrary combinations that would not be considered by a human.  

As the structures are two fused fragments, they are approaching the size of a drug-like molecule. 

All of these structures docked (Vina) at -9.0 -- -9.7 kcal/mol .

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0305,x0874,x0995",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/d2b455e2-4c45-4364-9fc0-1efc54e3e367,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well.

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step. At the final step, the 20 best structures in terms of energy were retained.",x1311,False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/bc954fb0-697e-491f-81af-b427532ff847,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0759,x1478",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/77cef4f8-69c7-4a42-be72-6e63eb0b6889,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

This module consists of two functional parts. The first provides pharmacophore-based mapping of targeted cavity by molecular fragments (probes) with their further minimization. The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step.

The second subprogram provides step-by-step linking of building blocks to the probes, taking into account the protein environment. Since ligands of crystal structures acted as initial probes in current experiment, only the second part of QSB module was used.
As starting molecules, ligands from 5REY, 5REN, 5RFG crystals were used. Model was built based on protein structure from 6LU7 crystal. Libraries of building blocks were obtained by fragmentation of molecules from Enamine 10K diverse collection with BRICS algorithm.
Five stages of structure building have been completed. In the first two stages, libraries of larger fragments (linkers) were used in order to extend the scaffold structure. At each of these two consecutive steps, the top 20 structures were selected by the module based on calculated energy values and then the top 5 of them were selected for further calculations based on expert evaluation. The next 3 stages were aimed at linking small functional groups and were performed automatically. During the first two stages the 5 best structures were automatically selected for the next step.

C=CC(=O)NCc1ccc(C(C)NC(=O)OC(C)(C)C)cc1,VIJ-CYC-1a3-10,"Vijay Shahani, Cyclica Inc.","We wanted to be informed by the set of fragments, but not fully reliant on matching fragments exactly, to drive our compound exploration. To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.  

Note, For this submission Cyclica’s Ligand Design was used in its default state with no algorithmic customization or further optimizations to strictly enforce the presence of select fragments. We are open to further customizing this LD design process in subsequent design iterations, in order to incorporate the the expert insights of medicinal chemists involved in this project.","x0072,x0161,x0995",False,False,False,https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/1a381570-5caa-4095-b2ba-625dc8939023,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
