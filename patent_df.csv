that makes sense based on an evodevoeco approach to the coronas in a combinatorial and comparative framwework 
morover they coevolved and can be produced fast with GMP and  isolated in relatively large amounts and high purity from staple crops and from biorests  

 they do dock quite well with 6lu7  (CASP) and makes sense in a evodevo context of the coronaviruses ( broad spectrum)  is now in a clinical double blind crossover study 

 the factory set up is ready in at lest three countries once the initial  study( last crossover was interfered by the outbreak in Spain but last crossover nacebo /placebo group we will also with an will also be offerd IgM and IgG kits) 

 but the same line of reasoning goes here  a prepared nes for that this is evolution in real time as well as a need to know a bit more if some of these especially natural compound can scale well it also can be done more efficient and serve as substrates for new compounds and synbio pathway redesigns/scaffolds

We also have some  peptides with O and N glyosylation /moieties and modification which might serve as boosting based on stable epitopes  of the M in nCOV but are not sure if that is on your agenda ?
